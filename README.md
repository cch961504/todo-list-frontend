# TODO List Frontend

Todo List Frontend implementation

## Possible improvement
- A Clear button to clean session
- Better code folder structure when more functions are added
- User typescript to catch type error on compile time
- Apply nicer layout
- Create RESTful backend to persist data with database
- User login, OAuth, SSO (currently just use browser storage to identify user)
- If backend with database is used, add cron job to cleanup data periodically
